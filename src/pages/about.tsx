            When I first embarked on my zero waste journey, I expected to spend
            more money on this lifestyle. But after a year of being zero (or as
            close to zero as I can get) waste, I noticed I had actually saved
            money. A lot of money.

            To help dispel the popular notion that being sustainable and
            eco-friendly is expensive, I wanted to create this blog to show how
            the opposite can be true.

          <Paragraph>
            I grew up in Colorado, playing soccer during the week and either
            hiking, biking, or skiing on the weekend depending on the season.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            I was constantly surrounded by nature. And I took it for granted.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            At 18 years old, I flew across the country to attend university in
            Boston. My limited access to the outdoors coupled with my new city
            boundaries and my heightened attention to the news made me realize
            how destructive humans were to the environment.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Trash littered every street. Rampant fires in California never
            seemed to cease. Hurricanes increased in intensity and frequency.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            These were just a few things that started to weigh on me.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            In the beginning of my senior year, I decided to do something.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            I didn't have any political clout nor really any other influence on
            others.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            What I did have were my own actions. So after hours of research, I
            decided to take measures into my own hands and start reducing my
            waste.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            I certainly wasn't perfect, and still am not now. But now I consider
            the environmental impact of every decision I make and I consider
            that a win.

      <Paragraph>
        Having just graduated from university in May of 2017 and starting my job
        in June, I have been uber conscious of how I spend and save my money.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        As soon as I signed my employment contract, I made a budget. To ensure
        that my money was being well spent I started diligently tracking my
        spending and discovered a few things.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The first is that I spend way too on Indian takeout. I have no regrets.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        But the second was that I saw a significant increase in my savings from
        when I wasn't zero waste.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I shocked both myself and my friends with these numbers and decided to
        document this journey.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        So here's my diary. All my musings, ideas, inspirations, everything
        related to zero waste and personal finance has been wrapped up into this
        one platform.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Welcome! If you're interested in lessening your footprint print while
        saving some mullah, you've come to the right place! I look forward to
        sharing this journey with you!

      <ol>
        <li>
          My last name starts with Pf (the 'P' is silent) so I wanted to keep a
          little piece of my identity in my blog name.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pf also stands for personal finance, which is a key focus of my blog
          and it's relationship to being zero waste
        </li>
        <li>
          Forwords, when said out loud, sounds like forwards, which is the
          direction I want to keep going in life. It acts as a symbol of
          progression
        </li>
        <li>
          The spelling of Forwords pays tribute to this page being a blog,
