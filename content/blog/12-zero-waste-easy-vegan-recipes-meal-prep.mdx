Ok, I’m going to be completely transparent right now.

**I am not a vegan.**

**I’m primarily a vegetarian for environmental reasons,** and I don’t think eating meat is necessary for the majority of people in today’s society. **I also don’t want something to die for me.**

That being said, **sometimes I slip up**. _Sometimes I have one of my boyfriend’s chicken wings or I accidentally eat a bite of BBQ chicken pizza at a work function._

I’m not perfect and don’t want to pretend to be. Carnivorous occurrences are rare but do happen.

That also being said, **I strive to eat a vegan diet**. I have hated milk since long before I was a vegetarian or zero waste, but I occasionally indulge in a piece of good cheese.

However, I have drastically cut down on my cheese intake since going zero waste, as I struggle to find cheese without plastic wrapping. And even when I can (e.g. if I get it at a restaurant or bring a container to the dairy counter), I often feel guilty afterward.

**These 12 meals** below are recipes I have discovered I love as they are **easy to make, vegan, delicious, and hold up well** throughout the week (as I meal prep every Sunday).

**They will cost you about \$25 too** (granted, this depends on what you already have stocked, but most of the time I make them my bill comes out to \$25 per recipe.)

Because I don’t have a lot of free time during the week between blogging, working out, and work, I meal prep on Sunday so I have lunches and dinners ready to go.

So here are my tried and true recipes that keep well throughout the week, so Thursday night dinner is not a total dread.

Bon appetit!

**Most all of these ingredients can be bought package free** from any conventional supermarket.

The one item I do struggle with is pasta as even my Whole Foods store doesn’t sell that in bulk (but they do in different locations).

For the pasta, I buy whatever box is the most cardboard and has the smallest plastic view window. After I’ve used up all the pasta, I peel the plastic window from the cardboard box and throw the box into the recycling and the plastic into the trash.
