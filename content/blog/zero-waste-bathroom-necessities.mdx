Creating a Zero Waste Bathroom doesn't have to be intimidating or scary, despite what it might seem (at least, it seemed that way to me!).

My biggest piece of advice is to use up what you already have before buying a more sustainable alternative. It's worse for the environment (and your wallet) if you throw out a plastic bottle of shampoo that still has useable shampoo in it.

Because at the end of the day, the most sustainable product is the one you already own.

### Stainless Steel Razor

I adore my Leaf Shave razor because it has a pivoting head, three blade slots, and gives a close shave! So not only is the base stainless steel and will last a lifetime, the blades are recyclable and suuuuuper cheap.

### Organic Cotton Towels From SOL Organics

I found myself finally in need of new towels and swapped my old ones for [SOL Organics organic cotton bath towels](https://solorganix.com/products/organic-bath-towel). And BOY OH BOY am I happy about that because these are the SOFTEST and most PLUSH towels I’ve ever used.

They are fair trade certified (no slave or child labor!) and made with organic cotton, and are shipped with minimal plastic packaging. Everything except the tape and little plastic tag hook, and sticky label can be composted. SOL Organics also donate $7.50 from each sale to one of the 4 charities they partnered with.

I mean, their statement from their Co-Founder, Sachin Chauhan, perfectly sums up why I love this company and what they stand for: _“Affordability is the tipping point. It promotes access, which in turn creates demand and conversion to organic cotton. It creates a symbiosis in which everyone wins: the farmer, the consumer and the earth.”_–Sachin Chauhan, Co-Founder 

Biggest bonus is that these towels are HUGE and I can wrap myself 1 ½ times over. No chances of my accidentally flashing the neighbors.

Don’t just take my word, [check out the other rave reviews on their site!](https://solorganix.com/products/organic-bath-towel)

### Online Refillable Shampoo and Conditioner

![](images/Plaine-Products-768x1024.png)

It’s no secret that I love [Plaine Products’ shampoo and conditioner](https://www.plaineproducts.com/shop/ref/taylorapfromer/). It’s one of the first swaps I made when transitioning my lifestyle and have never looked back.

I love the feel of liquid shampoo and conditioner. I tried using bars but I hated trying to get them to lather and actually rinse out (they clung to my hair like no other and no matter how many rinses never wanted to wash out.) And while I use them for travel (because I only carry-on luggage), I hated needing to use them in my normal life.

Plaine Products solved all those problems because they offer liquid shampoo and conditioner in aluminum bottles that are returnable (so it promotes a circular economy and keeps the bottles out of the trash).

Their formula works like the traditional stuff I was used to picking up at the grocery store, minus all the plastic and ingredients that aren’t good for our waterways.

### Skin Care

This one is harder to list because everyone’s skin is different. And as somone who struggled with cystic acne, I understand how difficult it can be to find skin care that works, and then you add on needing to find it in sustainable packaging?! That can be a tall order.

However, it is possible! And even if you’re only able to switch over a few products, keeping a few plastic options, that’s still better than nothing!

These are a few of the skincare products I love:

- [Meow Meow Tweet Tea Tree Charcoal Face Soap](https://meowmeowtweet.com/collections/face/products/tea-tree-eucalyptus-charcoal-bar-soap)
- [Yay for Earth Moisturizer](https://www.yayforearth.com/product-page/yayforearth-face-lotion-2oz) (disclaimer, I don’t use this myself but I make something similar & I’ve heard rave reviews of this from others)
- Raw honey face mask (that's right, I apply raw local honey directly ob my face because it has anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties which helps fight and soothe acne)

### Compostable Floss

[Made with silk, this floss is compostable](https://lifewithoutplastic.com/plastic-free-dental-floss-from-natural-silk-in-refillable-glass-jar-berry-blue/?aff=468) (but not vegan!). It holds up well between my teeth and rarely ever breaks! And when I'm done, I can pop it into my compost pile.

### Bamboo Toothbrush

This is such an easy swap if you're using manual toothbrushes.

Rather than buy a plastic base toothbrush, check out ones made from bamboo, like these [Brush with Bamboo](https://pforwords.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5b681306c07fa1e4485bea85e&id=d1f3f7451e&e=e8f0dd9a34) options.

Quick note: While the base itself is compostable (because it's wood), the bristles themselves are synthetic. Meaning when you're done with it, you'll need to take a pair of pliers to it to remove and throw out the bristles and then compost the base.

### Makeup Remover

The easiest and gentlest makeup remover: oil. 

You can use the oil cleansing method to take it off or pair it with a reusable cotton round. Apply the oil to your face or to the pad, massage onto skin, and then gently wipe away.

I see a lot of people recommend coconut oil. I’m hesitant to do so because it’s comedogenic, meaning that it has a high chance of clogging your pores. But you do wash it off after, so if that’s the only option you have I say go for it.

Otherwise, I recommend jojoba, rosehip, or olive oil.

As for the cotton rounds, I use [Marley's Monsters](https://earthhero.com/products/beauty-care/marleys-monsters-organic-reusable-makeup-remover-pads-marleys-monsters-earthhero/?ref=pforwords), but you can use any cotton cloth, or upcycle it from an old tshirt!

### Bar soap > body wash

[Zurich’s Institute of Environmental Engineering](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es901236f) found that **liquid soap has 10x the carbon footprint of bar soap** due to the chemicals that are used to manufacture liquid soap, plastic packaging required to create their bottles, and the innfieicnt shipping methods due to the bottle's shapes.

Skip the body wash and opt for bar body soap instead!

It works just as well as body wash, but at a fraction of the cost.

If you are needing a body wash, the one that I do fully support is Dr. Bronners’s castile soap. It’s super concentrated so it’ll last you a while, and can be used for so many different things like cleaning dishes, washing your dog, cleaning your counters, etc.

### Plants

If you follow me on Instagram, (shameless plug), you’ll know I’m OBSESSED with plants. I had 50 in my small 1-bedroom apartment in Boston (I’ve since moved back home to Colorado and am looking for a new space to move and establish my indoor jungle in).

This might not be a necessity for you, but it is for me! I need that pop of green in every room.

Low light plants that survive in my bathroom:

- Snake plant
- Zz plant
- Pothos
- Bamboo
