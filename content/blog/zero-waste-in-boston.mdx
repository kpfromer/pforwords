I’ve been living in Boston since 2013 when I came out here for undergrad. About 2 years ago (in the beginning of my senior year), I decided to go zero waste . It hasn’t been the easiest here in Boston, especially compared to when I was living in Boulder, CO. But over time I’ve discovered more stores that help while seeing the community incentivize more sustainable products here. So here are the stores that I like to shop at for different items.

## Compost

\-**[Bootstrap Compost](https://bootstrapcompost.com/tag/boston/):** Will pick up your food scraps to be composted on local farms. I pay \$24 per month for a bi weekly pickup, which works perfectly for me and my boyfriend.

\-Cambridge: The city offers curbside food scrap collection beginning in April 2018.

\-[**Project Oscar**](http://www.boston.gov/environment-and-energy/project-oscar): A free community compost pilot program that gives communities a place to drop-off residential food scraps. As of April 2017, there are bins in six locations: East Boston, North End, Brighton, Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, and City Hall Plaza.    
I've personally used the one in Brighton, which worked well (althought I inititally got lost trying to find it).
