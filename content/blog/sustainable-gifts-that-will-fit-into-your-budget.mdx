Sustainable gifts - they don't need to cost an arm and a leg (if you don't want them to).

Figuring out what others might want during the holiday gift-giving season is tough. And when you try to make it as sustainable and ethical, it can seem impossible.

But have no fear! Here’s a list of different items you can buy, make, or go do with your loved ones.

For the products you can buy, I wanted to focus on companies that are trying to make the world a better place in multiple ways.

So the products here are made from small companies, companies with ethical practices that treat their factory workers well, organizations that sustainably source their materials, or help promote a sustainable lifestyle.

I also don’t want people to feel like they have to fork over an arm and a leg to buy sustainable gifts either.

There are so many awesome and affordable gifts out there.

BUT I actually find the best gifts are experiences with my friends and family. I love going out to dinner, making cookies, or going on a hike with my peeps. Time with someone else is the best gift. But if that’s not your thing or you can’t do that (maybe you live far away), no judgment at all. Who doesn’t love a thoughtful, sustainable, and ethical gift?!

> Also, for all these zero waste stuff I have in my life (water bottle, thermos, bamboo toothbrush, etc), [check out my Favorite Products List!](https://pforwords.com/products/) Giving anything of there would be a great gift and would also help kickstart their eco-friendly lifestyle.

I've once again, partnered with Sol Organics to bring you this post! They make incredibly soft sheets and towels using organic cotton and are fair trade certified, making them a wonderful gift for this holiday season.

[![](images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-28-at-1.24.55-PM-min.png)](https://www.plaineproducts.com/shop/ref/taylorapfromer/)

I found [Plaine Product's shampoo and conditioner](https://www.plaineproducts.com/shop/ref/taylorapfromer/) two years ago and have never looked back.

All their stuff is packaged in aluminum bottles and shipped without plastic. And when you're done with it, you send it back to them and the wash and reuse it.

The best part is is that the products are super gentle (no parabens, sulfates, etc) but highly effective. The shampoo suds up really well and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and voluminous.

If you want to read more about how their process works and a more extensive review, [check out this blog post.](https://pforwords.com/zero-waste-shampoo-and-conditioner/)

I personally would love to get anything from their site (their body lotion is also to die for), so it might be a great gift for your loved ones!

## Make these sustainable gifts

[**3 kinds of scrubs for Lips, Face, and Body**](https://pforwords.com/3-diy-scrubs/)

![Make your own easy DIY Scrubs with natural and sustainable ingredients you probably have at home already! No weird chemicals and no plastic jars. These 3 scrubs will leave your face, body, and lips subtle, soft, and revitalized!](images/3-Easy-DIY-Scrubs-min-e1567095589329-1024x768.png)

[**Super Moisturizing Body Butter**](https://pforwords.com/3-steps-make-whipped-body-butter/)

This is cheap, fast, and easy to make! And best of all, it works really well at making and keeping skin soft.

[**Relaxing Weighted Eye Pillows**](https://www.bhg.com/crafts/sewing/accessories/do-it-yourself-eye-pillows/)

All you need is fabric, flax seeds or lentils, and optional lavender buds to create a tension soothing weighted eye mask.

[**Solid Perfume**](https://thethingswellmake.com/diy-easy-solid-perfume/)

With a liquid oil (like sweet almond or olive oil), wax (beeswax or candelilla wax), and some essential oils, you can create customizable solid perfumes for your friends!

**Plant Clipping Bouquet**

Take some clippings from your plants and place them into an upcycled glass jar. Spice it up by wrapping some twine and maybe a dried orange slice around the jar and you have a sweet gift that will cost you next to nothing (and can be made last minute!).

[**Shower Steamers**](https://www.busybliss.com/best-shower-steamers-recipe/)

Give the gift of a spa-like shower experience by making some shower steamers. And they only require simple ingredients: corn starch and essential oils. To use, you just put them in basin or tub of your shower and the light drizzle of water will release their scents.

[**Brownie Mix in a Jar**](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10646/brownie-mix-in-a-jar-ii/)

One of the easiest and best gifts out there. Put all the dry ingredients for brownies into a jar and give it to your friends and family. Whenever they want freshly baked brownies, all they have to do is add the liquid, mix, and bake.

## Sustainable Gifts - Experiences

**Spa day**

Book a facial or a massage for yourself and a friend, and spend all day in the steam room, sauna, and pool!

**Movie tickets**

**At home movie night**

Gift your partner a coupon to let them pick a movie. Then you can pop some popcorn (maybe add some pizzaz with jazzing it up with a caramel or chocolate sauce), make some hot cocoa, and get cozy under some blankets.

**Wine tastings**

If your friends or family like wine, see if there's a wine (or beer tasting) course near you! I highly recommend [Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/) to find some awesome deals.

**Concerts**

**Donations**

Give your loved one the option of choosing which foundation you'll donate to on their behalf.

### Wrapping it up

Wrapping - like gifts need to be wrapped? Eh eh, not bad? OK, bad pun, but regardless, I hope this post showed you that there are sustainable gifts out there that fit your budget, no matter how big or how small. And I know this is cheesy, but really what matters is time spent with one another so I hope that if you're able to, you have lovely holidays with your loved ones <3
