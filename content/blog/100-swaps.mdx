Zero Waste Swaps.

After you've evaluated your lifestyle and determined what areas could benefit from change, then you can start looking into products that will help you achieve your sustainable goals.

WAIT! Before you go running off to buy new stuff! I first want you to think about what you already own that you can use to live zero waste.

Because I've said it before and I'll say it again: **the most sustainable thing you can do is use what you already have.**

Then the next step is to see if you can upcycle something else to fit your needs (for example, clean a glass pasta sauce jar out and use that for a water bottle.) Then, to fill in the gaps, shop your second-hand stores first or see if you can upcycle something.

Then, **as a last resort**, buy your products new from these sustainable stores/companies.

You'll notice that most all of these links are sustainable e-commerce stores such as [Earth Hero](https://earthhero.com?ref=pforwords), [Life Without Plastic](https://lifewithoutplastic.com/?aff=468), or to the direct producers such as [Organic Basics](http://bit.ly/2XROyKB).

These companies / eCommerce stores are paving the way for sustainable products and shopping. I love supporting their mission (why give money to Jeff Bezos when these awesome companies exist?)!

If you want to see the [three online sustainable stores I trust to buy my stuff from, check out this post](https://pforwords.com/online-zero-waste-stores/)!

I hope this list will point you in the right direction!

### On-the-Go Swaps

[Insulated Thermos](http://earthhero.com/products/travel/klean-kanteen-wide-insulated-coffee-mug-20oz/?ref=pforwords) (I love Klean Kanteen because they're a certified B Corp and 1% for the Planet Member, and their products are incredibly durable!)

If not, then check your thrift store. If nothing piques your interest there, then consider investing in a high-quality insulated bottle - the insulation on this one keeps my water cold for hours, even when I leave it in the direct summer sun for hours.)
