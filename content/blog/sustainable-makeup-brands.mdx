Sustainable makeup made with clean ingredients is something that is super important to me. I don't want my skin absorbing toxic chemicals or for me to accidentally ingest something via my lip products.

As well, the conventional makeup industry has a laundry list of human rights violations and is terrible for the environment. [Child labor abuses, forced labor, deforestation, and water pollution](https://www.racked.com/2018/6/22/17492838/human-rights-sustainability-cosmetics-supply-chain) are just a few of the issues some of the large makeup companies are creating and contributing to.

But some makeup companies are trying to change that! So I wanted to create a list of sustainable makeup companies that are coming making their products with good ingredients and packaging them in sustainable containers (or no container at all!).

Bonus, I wanted to split them up by average price points so hopefully, you can find a products/company that fits in whatever budget you may have!

Not every company here will be perfect. But these are the few that I think are making awesome strides to be more sustainable while providing clean beauty items.

## Wrappin' it up!

I hope this list gave you some more options for clean, sustainable makeup brands for whatever budget you may have! It's crucial we wear makeup that isn't ladden with hidden toxic chemical because our skin absorbs a certain amount of whatever we put on it. Plus, I love that these companies are doing their part to help save the earth.
