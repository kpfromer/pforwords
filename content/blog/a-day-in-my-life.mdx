I find it fascinating knowing how people choose to spend their time. Given that we have a limited amount of it, how people use it really shows their values.

I've been obsessed with a 'Day in my Life' videos on Youtube and Money Diaries, so I thought maybe a contribution by me might interest you all.

While I wish I could say my life varies greatly, the truth is is that it doesn't, especially during the work week. I'm a creature of habit and a major homebody. I'm predictable and that's how I like it (unless I'm traveling and I then I'm all over exploring new things and trying different foods).

### Morning Option 1

**4:45 am** - Alarm not so gently wakes me up.

**5:15 am** - Make sure I grab my water bottle, get dressed, and call a Lyft Line to one of the gyms I frequent (I have a Class Pass). I realize how wasteful it is for both the environment and for my wallet to use a ride-sharing app but I can’t be bothered with the unreliable T so early and when it’s cold outside.

**7:30 am** - My class has probably ended and I’m all showered up thanks to the locker rooms at my gyms. I make sure to bring an old pillowcase or a bread bag to throw my sweaty workout gear in so I don’t use the plastic baggies they provide.

**7:45 am** - Apply my finishing touches to my make-up. I love using my [RMS concealer](https://www.rmsbeauty.com/products/un-cover-up), [black creamy cake mascara](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/527740620/black-creamy-cake-mascara-mineral-makeup?ref=related-1), and DIY brow powder (that's just cocoa and activated charcoal powders mixed together).

**8:00 am** - I arrive at work and drink the coffee I made the previous night.

I transport my coffee in my Klean Kanteen Thermos which I love because it doesn’t spill.

I bring coconut milk in a mason jar to work so I can add a little into my coffee to avoid the creamers provided by the office.

### Morning Option 2

**6:15 am** - My alarm rings and I hit snooze until 6:30 am

**6:30 am** - After I check Instagram for 10 minutes (a bad habit, I know) I hop into the shower.

**6:45 am** - Coffee and breakfast time! I heat up my water in my kettle and pour it over my grounds in my Chemex. I'll most likely have a variation of oatmeal with breakfast, topped with flax and hemp seeds.

I pack my coffee into my Klean Kanteen Thermos to enjoy while at work. For this moment, I'll have some warm water with lemon.

**7:30 am** - After I'm done eating breakfast and watching Youtube, I throw on a touch of makeup and get dressed.

**8:00 am** - Out the door and headed for the T in order to get to work by 8:20ish.

### Afternoon

**12:00 pm** - Lunch time! I bring my lunch from home every day except for Friday when work buys it for us. Sundays are my meal prep days and I put my lunches in one of three containers:

\-Glass containers if I need to heat up my food,

\-Lightweight airtight stainless steel bowl for salads and cold soups

\-Or my 3-in-1 stainless steel containers for multiple items and everything else!

**2:30 pm** - Continue to refill my water bottle with water and a wedge of lemon. I bring in a lemon to work every week to help me drink enough water.

### Evening

**5:45 pm** - Head out of work and take the T (Boston public metro system) home.

**6:30 pm** - Home and I reheat whatever I made on Sunday. Most likely it’s some sort of veggie and pasta dish that I douse in hot sauce. I know it’s not mentally good for me, but I park my ass in front of my tv and veg out while I eat.

**7:00 pm** - Blog time! Until I go to bed I’ll either write a post, work on some images, set up my Pinterest strategy, work on my ebook, etc. I'll light a few candles or my incense to help me start winding down from what's probably been a long (but fun) day.

**8:00 pm** - My sugar craving kicks in hard and I scrounge for something sweet. Sometimes I have chocolate chips I bought in bulk, but if I don’t, I get creative. I typically have the ingredients on hand to make peanut butter and jelly oats or homemade tortillas with butter and cinnamon sugar.

**9:00 pm** - I guarantee I’m pooped by this time I get ready for bed.

I’ll wash my face with [Meow Meow Tweet’s Charcoal Face Soap](https://meowmeowtweet.com/products/tea-tree-eucalyptus-charcoal-bar-soap).

I’ll either follow that up with a spritz of my apple cider vinegar toner or I’ll move straight onto moisturizing my face with a combo of oils. Right now I’m loving avocado and jojoba oil.

[Floss my teeth](https://pforwords.com/floss) and through it in my compost pile after (since it's compostable). I try to do this every night buuuut it might be really an every-other-night kind of thing. Oops.

Brush with my electric toothbrush or my [wooden compostable one](https://pforwords.com/toothbrush), whatever I'm in the mood for.

**9:30 pm** - I am out like a light.

## Wrapping it up!

Told you I was kind of boring! But I find it hard (and exhausting) to really switch it up during the week. I like my 'me' time when I'm home as that's the only time I really get to be alone (I work in an open concept office).

Knowing my schedule though also helps me anticipate how to avoid trash. If I know I am going to go to the gym, I'll pack my water bottle and not have to buy one while out, for example. Predictability can be sexy, right?
