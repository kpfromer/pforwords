Chemical conventional cleaners stink, both figuratively and literally (do they give anyone else a headache!).

[The Environmental Working Group](https://www.ewg.org/about-us),  a non-profit focused on public and environmental health, came out with their list [“Cleaners Hall of Shame”](http://static.ewg.org/reports/2012/cleaners_hallofshame/cleaners_hallofshame.pdf). They found, after extensive research as only **7%** **_adequately disclosed their contents_**_,_ **53% of cleaning products under review contained lung-harming ingredients**. In addition, well-known carcinogens like formaldehyde and chloroform were found in several cleaners. Gross.

While they may serve a purpose in limited cases, I prefer to use natural, safe ingredients to clean with. Which is why, when I need to clean around the house, I look to my cupboard (and the internet) to whip up different cleaning recipes. Normally, my recipes contain vinegar, lemon, baking soda, and/or castile soap.

And this recipe for cleaning my grungy sink is no different. All you’ll need is a lemon and baking soda.

## Why baking and lemon?

### Baking soda

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is an inexpensive, non-toxic, mild abrasive. You can use it safely on enamel, stainless and fiberglass sinks

### Lemon

Lemons are a natural disinfectant and are effective at removing rust stains because of their mild acidity. As an added bonus, lemons will leave your house with a pleasant scent.

## Instructions:

1. Sprinkle baking soda onto your dry sink basin (if it’s wet, the banking soda will be less effective so give it a quick wipe down with a rag if it’s damp.)
2. Rub the fleshy part of the lemon wedge into the baking soda
3. Rinse off to reveal your squeaky clean and shiny new sink!

Not going to lie, this post is shorter than I hoped and imagined. But that's because it's really just super simple. Hope this helps!!
