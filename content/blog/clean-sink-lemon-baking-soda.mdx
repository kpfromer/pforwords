Chemical conventional cleaners stink, both figuratively and literally (do they give anyone else a headache!).

[The Environmental Working Group](https://www.ewg.org/about-us),  a non-profit focused on public and environmental health, came out with their list [“Cleaners Hall of Shame”](http://static.ewg.org/reports/2012/cleaners_hallofshame/cleaners_hallofshame.pdf). They found, after extensive research as only **7%** **_adequately disclosed their contents_**_,_ **53% of cleaning products under review contained lung-harming ingredients**. In addition, well-known carcinogens like formaldehyde and chloroform were found in several cleaners. Gross.

While they may serve a purpose in limited cases, I prefer to use natural, safe ingredients to clean with. Which is why, when I need to clean around the house, I look to my cupboard (and the internet) to whip up different cleaning recipes. Normally, my recipes contain vinegar, lemon, baking soda, and/or castile soap.

And this recipe for cleaning my grungy sink is no different. All you’ll need is a lemon and baking soda.

## Why baking and lemon?

### Baking soda

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is an inexpensive, non-toxic, mild abrasive. You can use it safely on enamel, stainless and fiberglass sinks

### Lemon

Lemons are a natural disinfectant and are effective at removing rust stains because of their mild acidity. As an added bonus, lemons will leave your house with a pleasant scent.

## Instructions:

1. Sprinkle baking soda onto your dry sink basin (if it’s wet, the banking soda will be less effective so give it a quick wipe down with a rag if it’s damp.)
2. Rub the fleshy part of the lemon wedge into the baking soda
3. Rinse off to reveal your squeaky clean and shiny new sink!

## Before:

Not going to lie, this post is shorter than I hoped and imagined. But that's because it's really just super simple. Hope this helps!!
