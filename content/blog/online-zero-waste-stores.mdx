Online zero waste stores do exist! And thank god, because when I went zero waste, I was living in Boston, MA, where there weren't a lot of sustainable resources close by. So finding online zero waste stores changed the game for me because I could find all my sustainable product needs while supporting great online businesses.

However, shopping locally is a great way to support small businesses and bolster your community. However, sometimes there are just items you need that aren't accessible close by, like what I was experiencing in Boston.

Online bulk shops sell bulk beauty, household, and DIY products in packaging that you can recycle, compost, or return for refill and reuse.

Below, a full list of U.S.-based online bulk and refill shops. Some of the links below are affiliate links, which means I may make a small commission on items purchased, but it doesn't change your price at all.

### [Earth Hero](https://earthhero.com/?ref=pforwords)

[Earth Hero](https://earthhero.com/?ref=pforwords) is an online eco-friendly ecommerce site.

There really isn't much you can't find on this site! Which is one of the reasons this is my go-to online zero waste stores. The other reason I love them is because they provide the Sustainable Features of all their products, which makes it easy to identify why the product is actually sustainable.

They've done the research for us :)

Here's an example:

### [Arbor Teas](https://www.arborteas.com/)

Some grocery stores offer bulk teas or sell loose leaf teas in tin cans. But if you can't find that, check out [Arbor Teas](https://www.arborteas.com/).

Arbor teas offer organic loose-leaf teas in packages that are [backyard compostable](https://www.arborteas.com/compostable-packaging/). You can choose their largest “bulk” size to cut down on packaging even further.

Ships from Michigan.

### [The Refill Revolution](https://www.therefillrevolution.com/)

I love this zero waste store because it was started by my friend Brittany. You choose the container (tin, glass jar, or compostable bag), and you can either keep it or send it back to her for a refill (why the name is called [Refill Revolution](https://www.therefillrevolution.com/) haha.)

Find [bulk beauty products](https://www.therefillrevolution.com/products/), [bulk cleaning supplies](https://www.therefillrevolution.com/bulk-refills/), [bulk essential oils](https://www.therefillrevolution.com/essential-oils/), and [bulk DIY ingredients](https://www.therefillrevolution.com/raw-materials/). Some of my favorites: [Meow Meow Tweet deodorant](https://www.therefillrevolution.com/bulk-gallons/), [Meow Meow Tweet Tea Tree Charcoal Face Soap](https://www.therefillrevolution.com/products/tea-tree-charcoal-facial-soap-bar?rq=meow%20meow) , and [bulk shea butter](https://www.therefillrevolution.com/raw-materials/shea-butter-organic?rq=shea%20butter).

### Wrapping it up!

I hope this list provides you the resources to live sustainably, no matter where you live. But please remember, use what you already have and upcycle anything before buying new things :) This will not only be better for the environment, but also for your wallet!
